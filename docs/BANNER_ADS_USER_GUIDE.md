# Banner Ads - User Guide

## Overview

The events page displays banner advertisements from local vendors and businesses. These ads help support the community events platform while providing relevant information about local businesses and services.

## What You'll See

### Header Ads (Mobile)

On mobile devices, you'll see a smaller, mobile-friendly banner ad at the top of the events page, just below the filter controls. These ads are optimized for smaller screens and appear before the event listings.

### Body Ads (Desktop)

On desktop and tablet devices, you'll see full-width banner ads integrated within the event listings. These ads appear between event groups to provide natural breaks in the content.

## Ad Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ads automatically adjust to your device size
- **Clickable**: Click on any ad to visit the advertiser's website
- **Non-Intrusive**: Ads are designed to complement the events content without disrupting your browsing experience

## Privacy

Ad interactions (impressions and clicks) are tracked anonymously for analytics purposes. No personal information is collected or stored.

## Questions or Concerns

If you encounter any issues with ads or have questions, please contact the site administrator.
