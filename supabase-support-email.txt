Subject: Request to Restore Paused Project - Willing to Upgrade to Paid Plan

Hello Supabase Support Team,

I have a Supabase project that has been paused for over 90 days and cannot be restored through the dashboard. I'm writing to inquire about restoration options, as I'm willing to upgrade to a paid plan if that would enable restoration.

Project Details:
- Project Name: fiddletown-calendar
- Date Paused: June 23, 2024
- Status: Paused for over 90 days (dashboard restoration unavailable)

I understand that projects paused for over 90 days cannot be restored through the dashboard, but I wanted to check if:
1. Upgrading to a paid plan would enable restoration of this project
2. Your support team could assist with restoring the project directly
3. There are any other options available to restore this project without having to create a new project and restore from backup

I'm ready to upgrade to a paid plan if that would help restore this project. The dashboard indicates that all data is still intact, which is encouraging.

Thank you for your time and assistance. Please let me know what options are available.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
